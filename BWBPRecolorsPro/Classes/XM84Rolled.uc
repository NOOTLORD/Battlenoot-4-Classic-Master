// A fancy Karama based grenaded that is intended to behave more like a grenade
// that is rolled along the ground. Detonates 4 seconds after clip is released.
// The pineapple is not too effective a weapon in the hands of the amatuer, but
// once the user masters the timing, it will become a very deadly toy. Throw
// directly at opponents to provide them with a nasty concussion.
